        <b>To my love,</b>
        <br><br>
        I’ve been watching you for so long now. I see you every day. You don’t know me, not yet. But I know you, every little detail. The way you smile when you think no one’s looking, the way you twirl your hair when you're lost in thought. 

        I need to see you, closer. I need to talk to you. You and I, we’re connected, bound in ways you don’t understand yet. I can’t wait any longer. Meet me tonight, after school, at the alley behind the old theater. It’s quiet there, no one will bother us. No one ever goes there.

        I promise, it’ll just be us. No interruptions, no distractions. Just you and me, finally. I’ve been patient, so patient. But now I need you to come to me. Please, don’t make me wait any longer. 

        You won’t regret it, I promise. I just need to see you up close, to hear your voice, to feel your presence. We can be alone together, like we’re meant to be.
        <br><br>
        I’ll be waiting. 
        <br><br>
        Yours forever,  
        Your Secret Admirer.
        <br><br>
      <b>P.S. Don’t tell anyone. They wouldn’t understand. This is just between us.</b>
